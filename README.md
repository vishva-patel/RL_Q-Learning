Project 1 - Building Reinforcement Learning Environment

Due Date: Sunday, September 29, 11:59pm


## 1 Project Overview

The goal of the project is to explore and get an experience of building reinforcement learning environ-
ments, following the OpenAI Gym standards. The project consists of building deterministic and stochastic
environments that are based on Markov decision process, and applying tabular method to solve them.

## Part 1 [30 points] - Build a deterministic environment

Define a deterministic environment, where P (s 0 , r|s, a) = {0, 1}. It has to have more than one state and
more then one action.

Environment ideas:

• Tic-Tac-Toe

• Grid world

• Student’s Life

• Any your ideas are welcome



## Part 2 [30 points] - Build a stochastic environment

Define a stochastic environment, where
Part 1 can be used.



## Part 3 [40 points] - Implement tabular method

Apply a tabular method to solve environments, that were built in Part 1 and Part 2.
Tabular methods options:

• Dynamic programming

• Q-learning

• SARSA

• TD(0)

• Monte Carlo
